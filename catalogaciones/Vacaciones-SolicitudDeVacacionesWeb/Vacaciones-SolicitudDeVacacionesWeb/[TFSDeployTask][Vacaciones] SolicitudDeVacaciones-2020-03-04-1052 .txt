---------
This task do not need access to PROD Server 
Files copying are automated by TFS system. Only DataCenter approval triggers their starting 


FACT:
TFS informs an error after deploy, but it's often caused by files copying into D drive
In spite of this error message, we need to check,, with support of a Windows Server member, the existance of files after deploying (We do this proccessing on other task)
